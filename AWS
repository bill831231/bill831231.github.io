AWS doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html

Interface endpoint
Have to be set up inside a subnet



Gateway Endpoint
when you select Gateway endpoint, a group of routing will be added to you VPC routing table with endpoint ID as name
A rule with destination pl-xxx(com.amazonaws.eu-central-1.s3) and a target with this endpoints' ID (e.g. vpce-12345678) will be added to the route tables you select below.
Since these S3 routes are more specific then the default routes, the current connections with pub internet will be routed. AWS also gives a warning regarding this during creation
